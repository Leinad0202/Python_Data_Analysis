Description:
Data analysis project using Pandas focused on cancellation data. The notebook examines patterns, statistics, and possible insights from the provided dataset.

Open the main.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment (JupyterLab/Notebook, Google Colab, etc.).

Make sure cancelamentos.csv is in the same folder as the notebook.

Run the cells sequentially.

Features:

Loads and explores cancellation data.

Performs data cleaning (handling missing or inconsistent data).

Calculates descriptive statistics (mean, median, dispersion, etc.).

Generates visualizations (bar charts, histograms, boxplots, etc.) to understand key variables.

Technologies:
Python, Pandas (data analysis), Matplotlib/Seaborn (data visualization).

Learnings:
DataFrame manipulation, exploratory data analysis, visualization techniques, and data interpretation.
