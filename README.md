Open main.ipynb in a Jupyter environment (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc.).

Ensure cancelamentos.csv is in the same folder as the notebook.

Execute the notebook cells sequentially.

Features
Load and explore cancellation data.

Perform data cleaning (handle missing or inconsistent data).

Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, dispersion, etc.).

Generate visualizations (bar charts, histograms, boxplots, etc.) to analyze key variables.

Technologies
Python

Pandas (data analysis)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (data visualization)
